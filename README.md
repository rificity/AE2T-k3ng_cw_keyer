WARNING: This is a pared-down version of the code. It only contains files for the K5BCQ keyer version. It does contain some customizations that I prefer.

K3NG Arduino CW Keyer

The K3NG Keyer is an open source Arduino based CW (Morse Code) keyer with a lot of features and flexibility, rivaling commercial keyers which often cost significantly more. The code can be used with a full blown Arduino board or an AVR microcontroller chip can be programmed and used directly in a circuit. This keyer is suitable as a standalone keyer or for use permanently installed inside a rig, especially homebrew QRP rigs. Itâ€™s open source code so you can fully customize it to fit your needs and also perhaps learn from it or find coding ideas for other projects.

The K5BCQ version of the keyer is based on a board designed by Kees, K5BCQ and others on the Radioartisan groups.io message board https://groups.io/g/radioartisan. It is based on a Arduino Mega2560-mini board and combines a number of fetures that won't all fit on a Uno or Nano. Board and kit available at https://www.qsl.net/k5bcq/Kits/Kits.html
